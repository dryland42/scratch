                    <p>Our Guest Service teams are made up of wonderful volunteer leaders across many different areas. We want all people to experience the love of Christ as they show up at Grace. Our purpose for Guest Services is to make all feel welcomed, loved, and accepted for who they are and where they are on life's journey. The Connect desk volunteers serve to welcome our guests, share additional information with them, and serve other volunteer leaders. Greeters serve through warm handshakes and kind words to make everyone feel welcome while ushers serve by helping you find your seat and collecting morning offerings. The coffee team serves hot coffee and warm smiles every Sunday morning and our safety team serves to create an environment that provides well-thought-out care and safety services for everyone.</p>
