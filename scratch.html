                <p>Our Guest Service teams are made up of wonderful volunteer leaders across many different
                    areas.
                    We want all people to experience the love of Christ as they show up at Grace. Our purpose
                    for
                    Guest Services is to make all feel welcomed, loved, and accepted for who they are and where
                    they
                    are on life's journey. The Connect desk volunteers serve to welcome our guests, share
                    additional
                    information with them, and serve other volunteer leaders. Greeters serve through warm
                    handshakes
                    and kind words to make everyone feel welcome while ushers serve by helping you find your
                    seat
                    and collecting morning offerings. The coffee team serves hot coffee and warm smiles every
                    Sunday
                    morning and our safety team serves to create an environment that provides well-thought-out
                    care
                    and safety services for everyone.</p>
